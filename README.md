This is a script that can merge PDFs. Because it is difficult for me to find a fast, easy-to-use and free PDF merging software, I wrote a python script to solve this problem.
Put the PDFs to be merged into the PDF folder, and then run the py script to merge!
Remember to pip install PyPDF2 first when compiling in the python environment.
